## Application Layer

Acts as the User Interface that combines business logic and customer interactions.

* Browser dApps
* Decentralized Applications
* Chaincode

## Services and Optional Components

Serves to enable application operations to connect with other technologies and platforms.

* Governance/DAOs
* Smart Contracts
* Oracles
* Wallets
* Digital Assets
* Data Feeds
* Off-Chain Computing
* Blockchain Monitor

## Protocol Layer

Decides the methods of consensus and network participation.

* Consensus (PoW, DAG, PoS, PoA, PoE, BFT, PoL, PoET, etc.)
* Side Chains
* Permissioned and Permissionless
* Propagation Protocol
* EVMs

## Network Layer

Acts as a transportation medium and interface for the P2P network and decides how data is packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

* Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
* Communication Mechanisms
* Verification Mechanism
* RPLx
* Block Delivery
* Trusted Execution Enviroment (TEE)

## Data Layer

This layer acts as the blockchain data structure and physical storage. The ledger is built using a linked list or Merkel trees of blocks, which are encrypted using asymmetric encryption.

* Digital Signatures
* Hash
* Merkle Tree
* Transactions
* Data Blocks
* Asymmetric Encryption
* Storage

## Infrastructure Layer

In-house infrastructure or Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) that provides the necessary hardware and software to run the blockchain and control de nodes.

* Mining
* Network
* Nodes
* Virtualization
* Tokens
