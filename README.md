# â›“ Blockchain Common Attack Techniques

Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we think about data security, but it is not immune to attacks. In these documents, we will explore the most common attack techniques used against blockchain networks, including 51% attacks, double-spending, Sybil attacks, and more. We will also discuss the potential consequences of these attacks and provide recommendations for how to protect against them. This document is intended for blockchain security researchers, developers, and users who want to gain a deeper understanding of the security risks associated with blockchain technology
